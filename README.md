# Python-Based-Port-Scanner

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This port scanner is using a multithreading approach where separate threads are created for each port scan. This makes it possible to scan the ports simultaneously and increase the speed of the port scan. The speed of the scan also depends on the targeted host's response time. </p>
